1. Creating a Table
    CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES(EMPLOYEEID INT PRIMARY KEY,FIRSTNAME VARCHAR(50),LASTNAME VARCHAR(50),DATEOFBIRTH DATE, DEPARTMENT VARCHAR(20));
    CREATE TABLE ORDERNAMES(ORDERID INT PRIMARY KEY,ORDERDATE DATE,CUSTOMERID INT,AMOUNT DECIMAL(10,2));

2. Inserting Data into a Table
    INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES(EMPLOYEEID,FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME,DATEOFBIRTH,DEPARTMENT) VALUES(1,"CHAITHRA","AVETI","12-11-2005","CSE");
    INSERT INTO ORDERNAMES(ORDERID,ORDERDATE,CUSTOMERID,AMOUNT) VALUES(1,'12-11-2005',101,200.34);

3. Selecting Data from a Table
Select all columns:
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES
    SELECT * FROM ORDERNAMES;
Select specific columns:
    SELECT FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME FROM EMPLOYEES
    SELECT ORDERID,AMOUNT FROM ORDERNAMES

4. Updating Data in a Table
    UPDATE EMPLOYEES SET DEPARTMENT='FINANACE' WHERE EMPLOYEEID=1;
    UPDATE ORDERNAMES SET AMOUNT=500 WHERE ORDERID=1; 

5. Deleting Data from a Table
    DELETE FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE EMPLOYEEID=1;
    DELETE FROM ORDERNAMES WHERE AMOUNT<100;

6. Filtering Data with WHERE Clause
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE Department = 'HR';
    DELETE FROM ORDERNAMES WHERE AMOUNT>300;

7. Using AND / OR in Queries
Using AND:
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE DEPARTMENT='HR' AND DATEOFBIRTH>'1990-01-01';
    SELECT * FROM ORDERNAMES WHERE AMOUNT>300 AND ORDERDATE<'2023-01-01';

Using OR:
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE DEPARTMENT='HR' OR DEPARTMENT='FINANCE';
    SELECT * FROM ORDERNAMES WHERE AMOUNT<100 OR ORDERDATE>'2023-01-01';

8. Sorting Results with ORDER BY
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES ORDER BY LASTNAME ASC;
    SELECT * FROM ORDERNAMES ORDER BY AMOUNT DESC;

9. Using Aggregate Functions
Counting rows:
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEES;
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ORDERNAMES;
Finding the average age:
    SELECT AVG(AMOUNT) FROM ORDERNAMES;
    2.ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES ADD AGE VARCHAR(10)
    UPDATE EMPLOYEES SET AGE=20 WHERE EMPLOYEEID=1;
    UPDATE EMPLOYEES SET AGE=24 WHERE EMPLOYEEID=2;
    SELECT AVG(AGE) FROM EMPLOYEES;

10. Grouping Data with GROUP BY
SELECT DEPARTMENT, COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEES GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
SELECT CUSTOMERID, SUM(AMOUNT) FROM ORDERNAMES GROUP BY CUSTOMERID;

11. Using HAVING Clause
    SELECT DEPARTMENT, COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEES GROUP BY DEPARTMENT HAVING COUNT(*)>5
    SELECT CUSTOMERID, SUM(AMOUNT) FROM ORDERNAMES GROUP BY CUSTOMERID HAVING SUM(AMOUNT)>5

12. Joining Tables
Inner Join:
    SELECT EMPLOYEES.FIRSTNAME,EMPLOYEES.LASTNAME,ORDERNAMES.AMOUNT FROM EMPLOYEES
        JOIN ORDERNAMES ON EMPLOYEES.EMPLOYEEID=ORDERNAMES.ORDERID
Left Join:
    SELECT EMPLOYEES.FIRSTNAME,EMPLOYEES.LASTNAME,ORDERNAMES.AMOUNT FROM EMPLOYEES 
        LEFT JOIN ORDERNAMES ON EMPLOYEES.EMPLOYEEID=ORDERNAMES.CUSTOMERID
